This repository contains core code for an Unreal Engine based video game I'm working on.

It's most important component is the **Cubic Voxels Plugin**. 
It is an **Unreal Engine 5 plugin** that allows you to **procedurally generate infinite block-based words**. It supports:

  -Worlds that extend infinitely in all directions

  -Unlimited block types with texture packs
  
  -World editing
  
  -World saving and loading from disk

  -Multiplayer replication and sending the world over the network (work-in-progress as of now)
  
This code is distributed under a **GNU GPLv3 licence**
