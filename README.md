This repository contains core code for an Unreal Engine based video game I'm working on.

It's most important component is the **Cubic Voxels Plugin**. 
It is an **Unreal Engine 5 plugin** that allows you to **procedurally generate infinite block-based words**. It supports:

  -An infinite number of blocks
  
  -World editing
  
  -World saving and loading from disk
  
  -Sending the world over the network

This code is distributed under a **GNU GPLv3 licence**
